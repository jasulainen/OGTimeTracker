# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TimeTracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) demonstration of a simple time tracking solution with automatic notification-based task management. The core concept is that users don't need to remember to update their current task - the app automatically sends notifications asking if they're still working on the same thing, allowing them to confirm or switch tasks effortlessly.

Built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with Tailwind CSS, it features a modern, professional interface while running entirely in the browser using localStorage for data persistence.

## Architecture

- **Single Page Application**: All functionality contained in one HTML page
- **Modern UI**: Tailwind CSS via CDN for responsive, professional design
- **Modular ES6 Structure**: Clean separation of concerns with ES6 modules
- **No Build Process**: Direct JavaScript execution, no transpilation or bundling
- **PWA Features**: Service worker for offline functionality and push notifications
- **Client-side Storage**: Uses localStorage for task persistence
- **File System Integration**: Chrome/Edge File System API for direct file persistence
- **Observable State Management**: Simple reactive state pattern for UI updates
- **Configurable Notification System**: Browser notifications at user-configurable intervals (1-360 minutes) asking "Still working on [task]?" - the core feature that eliminates manual task switching

## Development Commands

This project has no build system, package.json, or dependency management. To develop:

1. **Run locally**: Serve files via HTTP server (not file://)
   ```bash
   # Example using Python
   python -m http.server 8888
   # Or using Node.js
   npx serve .
   ```

2. **Test PWA features**: Must be served over HTTPS or localhost for service worker and notifications to work

3. **No linting/testing**: No automated testing or linting configured

## Code Structure

### Storage Layer (`modules/storage.js`)
- File System API integration for direct file persistence
- localStorage fallback for browser compatibility
- Export/import functionality for history backup (JSON and CSV formats)
- Automatic file handle management
- CSV export optimized for Excel with separate date/time columns

### State Management (`modules/state.js`)
- Observable state pattern for reactive UI updates
- Centralized state for current task, history, and storage status
- Subscription-based state change notifications

### Business Logic (`modules/taskManager.js`)
- Task operations: start, switch, complete, stop
- ID-based task registry with autocomplete support
- History management: add, clear, export (JSON/CSV), import
- Time calculation and formatting utilities
- File system operations coordination

### UI Components (`modules/ui.js`)
- Modular UI rendering functions
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Tab-based interface (Tracking/Preferences)
- Date-based history navigation
- Stop button for manual task completion
- Export dropdown menu (JSON/CSV options)
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- User feedback and error handling

### Notification Service (`modules/notifications.js`)
- Service worker integration for PWA notifications
- Configurable notification intervals (1-360 minutes) via preferences
- User interaction handling for task switching
- **Fixed**: Notification clicks now properly reuse existing PWA instances instead of opening new ones

### Main Controller (`modules/app.js`)
- Application initialization and coordination
- Event listener setup and management
- Tab switching and preferences integration
- Module orchestration and lifecycle management
- Global app state and debugging interface

### Preferences Management (`modules/preferences.js`)
- User settings persistence in localStorage
- Configurable notification intervals (1-360 minutes)
- Settings validation and defaults
- Future-ready for theme and formatting preferences

### Utility Functions (`modules/utils.js`)
- Task ID generation and validation
- Date/time formatting for CSV export
- Duration calculations and formatting
- CSV field escaping and data processing

### Date Filtering (`modules/dateFilter.js`)
- Date-based history filtering and navigation
- Daily summary calculations
- Date picker integration
- Today/previous/next date navigation

### Autocomplete (`modules/autocomplete.js`)
- Task name suggestion system
- ID-based task matching and aggregation
- Keyboard navigation support
- Real-time filtering and selection

## Important Implementation Notes

- **Core Feature - Configurable Notifications**: User-configurable intervals (1-360 minutes) ask "Still working on [task]?" with Yes/No actions
- **User Experience**: Users never need to remember to update their current task manually
- **Notification Actions**: "Yes" dismisses notification, "No" focuses task input for switching
- **Stop Button**: Manual task completion with ðŸ›‘ Stop Tracking button
- **Preferences Tab**: Settings for notification intervals, future theme options
- **Data Persistence**: 
  - **File System API**: Chrome/Edge 86+ can save directly to local files
  - **localStorage Fallback**: Other browsers use browser storage
  - **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects and uses best available storage
- **File Management**: Export/import functionality with dual format support:
  - **JSON Export**: Complete data backup with all fields
  - **CSV Export**: Excel-optimized format with separate date/time columns for analysis
- **Task ID System**: Comprehensive ID-based task registry for proper aggregation and autocomplete
- **Date Navigation**: Filter history by date with daily summaries and navigation controls
- **Autocomplete**: Intelligent task suggestions based on history
- **Service Worker**: Handles offline caching and notification click events
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation
- **PWA Ready**: Includes manifest.json and service worker for installation

## Editing Guidelines

When modifying this codebase:
- **Modular Structure**: Keep functionality separated into appropriate modules
- **ES6 Modules**: Use import/export syntax for module communication
- **State Management**: Use the observable state pattern for UI updates
- **UI Components**: Add new UI elements through the UIComponents class
- **Storage Operations**: Use the StorageManager for all data persistence
- **Business Logic**: Keep task-related logic in TaskManager
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling (loaded via CDN)
- Test PWA features on localhost or HTTPS
- Update service worker cache version when changing cached files
- Ensure notification permissions are properly handled
- Test File System API in Chrome/Edge for file persistence features
- Maintain localStorage fallback for browser compatibility
- Use async/await for all storage operations due to File System API
- Follow the established design system with consistent spacing and colors

### Adding New Features
1. **UI Changes**: Modify `modules/ui.js` for new UI components
2. **Business Logic**: Add methods to `modules/taskManager.js`
3. **Storage**: Extend `modules/storage.js` for new data operations
4. **State**: Add new state properties to `modules/state.js`
5. **Integration**: Wire everything together in `modules/app.js`
